## General info
The main goal of the project is to be able to accurately predict the weather in Australia. 
Using several classification methods, such as random forest and bagging, this project aims to compare the prediction ability of these algorithms, limited to this dataset. A summary of the findings can be found in WAUS2019_REPORT.pdf .
The data is similar to the one found here: https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
